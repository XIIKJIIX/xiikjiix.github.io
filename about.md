# Weeruhputt Supsohmboon

Currently studying Information Technology at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand.

I attended some special courses in my area of interest such as Bioinformatics, Machine Learning and Microservices System Architecture. These were courses taught in my campus. Furthermore, I also enrolled in “Understanding Quantum Computer” online course from Futurelearn, which clarified many cryptic quantum computation concepts. I previously interned at Sellsuki Co. Ltd. to prototype a product image classifier for an internal use, using Python and Tensorflow to provide classification service using a restful api.

My recently and firstly publication is the “Fashion Finder: A System for Locating Online Stores on Instagram from Product Images”. I and my colleagues have proposed a platform to assist consumers in their search for Instagram's online stores that sell their desired cloth or an equivalent one. By applying a convolution neural network to automatic clothing segmentation, and then to match the segmented piece of cloth with existing pieces of cloth in an our self crawled Instagram picture database.

My area of interest lies in the intersection of quantum circuit and neural networks by applying a tensor network circuit, for example, for machine learning tasks. 
As a subset of quantum circuit, the tensor network circuit could be implemented on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to build discriminative and generative approach classifiers.
